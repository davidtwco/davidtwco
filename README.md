# David Wood - @davidtwco
ðŸ‘‹ - Iâ€™m David, a software engineer from Scotland, with an interest in systems software and open
source software. Youâ€™ll find me as `davidtwco` around the internet, or on [my website][website].

## Open Source
Contributing to open source is a lot of fun and I love doing it - I mostly contribute to rustc,
the compiler for the Rust programming language (as a [compiler team
contributor][compiler_team_contributor], a stepping stone to full compiler team membership).
Throughout my time contributing, I've been a member of the [non-lexical lifetimes (NLL)][wg_nll],
[async/await][wg_async_await] and [diagnostics][wg_diagnostics] working groups and have been a
co-lead of the [polymorphisation][wg_polymorphisation] and [meta][wg_meta] working groups. My
contributions have included the [`#[non_exhaustive]` attribute from RFC 2008][rfc_2008] and
polymorphisation, a code-size/compile-time optimisation for reducing unnecessary monomorphisation.

I've also contributed to other open source projects, such as NixOS - a reproducible Linux
distribution - and Zulip - a real-time chat application with threading. You can find [an exhaustive
list of my open source contributions on GitHub][prs].

## Personal Infrastructure
I love investing in things that will pay off in the long-term, so I've maintained a dotfiles
repository for years. The most recent manifestation of this is [`veritas`][veritas], my personal
mono-repo which contains the declarative configuration for all of my desktops, servers and laptops -
including dotfiles, packages and my website!
